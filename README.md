# 📌 Overview\
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify reviews as positive or negative based on the text content.

By analyzing customer feedback, businesses can:\
✔️ Gain insights into consumer preferences\
✔️ Improve product offerings\
✔️ Enhance customer satisfaction\

# 📂 Dataset
📌 **Dataset Source:** [Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)\
Contains 568,454 food product reviews from Amazon\
Includes ratings (1-5), review text, summary, and timestamps\
Cleaned to remove personal information\
# 🛠 Project Workflow\
## 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing\
✔️ Handling missing values\
✔️ Removing stopwords, punctuation, and special characters\
✔️ Tokenization & Lemmatization\
✔️ Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, BERT embeddings)\

## 2️⃣ Handling Imbalanced Data\
✔️ Reviews are often highly skewed towards positive ratings\
✔️ Techniques used to balance the dataset:\
    Under-sampling (removing excess positive reviews)\

## 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
✔️ Distribution of Ratings and Sentiments\
✔️ Word Clouds for Positive & Negative Reviews\
✔️ Top Frequent Words in each sentiment category\

## 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model\
✔️ Traditional models:  Naive Bayes\
✔️ Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix\

## 5️⃣ Business Impact & Insights\
✔️ Identify key themes in positive and negative reviews\
✔️ Provide data-driven recommendations to businesses\
✔️ Help optimize product quality and marketing strategies\

# 📊 Results & Insights\
📌 Sentiment Distribution visualized using bar plots\
📌 Word Clouds for frequently used words in reviews\
📌 Performance Metrics for different models\
📌 Effectiveness of Imbalance Handling compared with raw data\
